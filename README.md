# PVWindGridBalancer

PVgridBalancer is a modular renewable energy forecasting framework designed to provide accurate solar (PV) and wind power predictions, along with a structured foundation for future grid balancing intelligence.

The system is built using production-safe machine learning pipelines with time-series validation and robustness testing to ensure reliability under real-world conditions.

## Project Overview

The primary objectives of this repository are:

- Develop accurate photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting models  
- Develop accurate wind power forecasting models  
- Perform stress testing under noisy conditions  
- Provide a scalable foundation for future grid balancing intelligence  

This repository currently focuses on the forecasting layer. The grid balancing engine will be implemented in future phases.
